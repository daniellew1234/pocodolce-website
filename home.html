<h2> CHOCOLATES & CONFECTIONS HAND-CRAFTED IN SAN FRANCISCO</h2>
<p>Poco Dolce Confections was started by Kathy Wiley in 2003 as a small San Francisco baking company 
specializing in regional Italian pastries.  Within a year, she discovered a passion for creating hand-made
chocolates with unique and exciting flavors. Having a predilection for more savory foods, Kathy experimented
by finishing a piece of bittersweet chocolate with a sprinkling of Grey Sea Salt (also known as Sel Gris). 
Poco Dolce's bittersweet chocolate Tiles were born.
The name - Poco Dolce - literally translates from Italian as "not too sweet" or "just a little sweet."  
Applying this idea to their products, Poco Dolce's ongoing mission is to stay on the "savory side of sweet."

<h2>SIMPLE, FRESH, ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENTS</h2>
<p>Run by a ten person team for most of the year, the utmost attention and care is put into crafting each 
and every product.  Created in small batches in their San Francisco kitchen, Poco Dolce's hand-made chocolates
and confections feature only the finest, all-natural ingredients - from local almonds and pumpkin seeds to 
grey sea salt harvested from the coast of Brittany.  Poco Dolce's signature Sea Salt Toffee has just three 
ingredients - sugar, California butter, and sea salt.  The completely dairy-free line of Bittersweet Chocolate
Bars continues to feature quality ingredients by using inclusions like peanut butter and California olive oil. 
As of Dec, 2013, Poco Dolce no longer uses corn syrup in any products. 95% of Poco Dolce's products are 
GMO-Free and gluten-free. (The exceptions are the St Paddy's Day Box, Whiskey Box, and Trento Box, which all
contain some gluten.)</p>
<br/>
<h2>ENVIRONMENTALLY AND SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS CHOCOLATE</h2>
<p>Poco Dolce always uses multiple blends of GMO-Free chocolate from Guittard Chocolate Company. Located 
just 15 miles south of San Francisco in Burlingame, California, Guittard makes it a point to work directly
with their farmers, cutting out the "middle men," and using cacao beans that are Rainforest Alliance certified
and Fair Trade certified. They also pay a premium well over market value for the beans in order to support 
the farmers they work with, and are a member of the World Cocoa Foundation which, among many other causes, 
supports the Cocoa Livelihoods Program which works towards ensuring quality of life for workers through 
sustainable cacao growing.</p>
