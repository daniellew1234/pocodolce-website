<p>Hello, My name is Michael Tran and I am one of the designers for this website, Poco Dolce.
One of the main goals I had intended for this website was to bring more attention to the various
social media  channels that Poco Dolce had to offer. Followers and traffic has seemed to hit a bottleneck across the various channels of Poco Dolce. 
By bringing more attendion to social media I hope to increase sales and the number of loyal returing customers.
